Introduction
This repository includes everything you need to kickstart your VR development in Unity. It includes example scenes, scripts, and custom assets optimized for VR platforms such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and others. Unity is a powerful game engine that, combined with VR technologies, allows you to create interactive, immersive virtual worlds.

Features
VR Interaction System: Pre-built components to handle common VR interactions (grabbing objects, teleportation, button presses).
Optimized Prefabs: Custom-built VR player controllers and camera rigs, designed for high performance.
Sample Scenes: Demonstrations of different VR mechanics like grabbing, movement, and UI interaction.
Cross-Platform Support: Compatible with various VR headsets like Oculus, HTC Vive, and others.
Performance Optimization: Best practices for VR development, such as frame rate maintenance and object culling.
Installation
To get started with the Unity VR project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/unity-vr-repository.git
Install Unity:
If you haven't already, download and install Unity Hub, and ensure you have the latest version of Unity installed.

Unity Download
Import the project into Unity: Open Unity Hub, click "Add," and select the folder where you cloned this repository. Unity will load the project.

Install XR Plugin Management (if needed): If you're using Unity 2020 or later, make sure you have the XR plugin management package installed:

Go to the Package Manager (Window -> Package Manager).
Install XR Plugin Management.
After installation, enable the appropriate XR settings for your VR device (e.g., Oculus, OpenXR).

Setup
Configure the Player Settings for VR:

Go to Edit -> Project Settings.
In the Player settings, ensure the XR Settings are configured to support your target VR platform.
Import necessary SDKs:
For specific VR platforms, you may need to import additional SDKs. For example, for Oculus:

Download the Oculus Integration from the Unity Asset Store.
Follow the instructions to configure the Oculus SDK in Unity.
Usage
Once everything is set up, you can:

Open the sample scenes:
Navigate to the Assets/Scenes folder and open any of the provided VR demo scenes.

Play the scene:
Press the Play button in Unity to test the VR interactions in the editor. Ensure your VR headset is connected and active.

Modify and extend:
Customize the provided components to suit your specific VR application needs. Add more interactions, objects, and environments to build your experience.

Example VR Interaction
Hereâ€™s a quick look at how the grabbing interaction works:

The VRGrab script allows you to grab objects by using a VR controller.
Attach the script to any interactable object.
The object will now be grabbable in VR when the player reaches for it.
For teleportation, the system uses raycasting to indicate available teleportation zones. Adjust the settings in the VRTeleportation prefab to control the range and movement type.
